# Pi Estimation Using Monte Carlo Simulation

This project demonstrates how to estimate the value of Pi (Ï€) using the Monte Carlo method. By simulating random points within a square that bounds a unit circle, we can approximate the area of the circle and thereby estimate Pi. This method is a straightforward example of applying statistical techniques to solve problems that might seem purely mathematical at first glance.

## Background

The Monte Carlo method is a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The idea is to simulate the process many times and use probability statistics to derive a result. In the case of Pi estimation, the principle used is that the probability of a randomly placed point within the square also lying within the quarter circle is proportional to the area of the circle.
